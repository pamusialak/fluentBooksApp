# Fluent Books ‚Äì Personalized Multilingual Books App üìöüåç

This Android app is being developed for **Fluent Books Publishing** with the goal of making it easy to personalize children's books by language.

## Project Goal

Fluent Books has books translated into many languages, but personalizing them manually is time-consuming. This app will streamline the process by letting users choose:

- A book
- One or more target languages

The app will then dynamically display and format each page based on the selected language, allowing users to preview or generate the final book layout.

## Features (Planned)

- User login and basic authentication
- Book selection and preview
- Page-by-page multilingual display
- Export-ready formatting

## Database Collections

- `users`: stores user account data
- `books`: general book information
- `book_pages`: content of each page in different languages

See `database_collections.txt` in the root for details.

## UI Design

The app follows Google's **Material Design** guidelines.  
All mockups are included in the PDF file: `mockups.pdf`.

## Tech Stack

- **Kotlin**
- **Android Studio**
- **Git + GitHub** for version control

## Current Progress

- ‚úÖ Project initialized in Android Studio
- ‚úÖ First activity scaffolded
- ‚úÖ Wireframes/mockups designed
- ‚úÖ Database structure planned
- ‚úÖ Repository published
